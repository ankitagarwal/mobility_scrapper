This is a repo to scrape the data from Google's COVID19 community mobility reports https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/. This code is released freely under the MIT Licence, and provided 'as-is'.

This project is built in python and extracts just the headline mobility comparison figures from Google's PDFs. This is inspired by the work below - 

* Mobility Extractor in R(https://github.com/mattkerlogue/google-covid-mobility-scrape/)
